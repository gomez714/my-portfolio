  bio: `I build software that isn't just fast and scalable — it feels good to use. 
  As a Software Engineer, I specialize in crafting smooth, high-performance applications with React, .NET, and Kubernetes, 
  ensuring every interaction is seamless, intuitive, and efficient. Whether it's designing pixel-perfect UIs, optimizing backend workflows, 
  or securing cloud infrastructure, my focus is on creating tech that not only works flawlessly but also enhances user experience at every level.

  Before I was writing clean, scalable code, I was choreographing performances as a dancer. I earned a BFA in Dance from UCSB, 
  and that experience shaped the way I think about problem-solving—balancing structure with creativity, precision with flexibility. 
  Outside of engineering, I train in kickboxing, experiment with photography using my Panasonic GX85, and host a podcast, The Bottom Left Pane, 
  where I explore stories of resilience, mental health, and personal growth.

  If you're looking for a developer who values clean code, agile collaboration, and problem-solving, let's connect.`
